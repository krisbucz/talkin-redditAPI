# Talkin Reddit API
This is my React App "Talkin" made for the codecademy Reddit Client project from the PATH.

## Wireframes

| Initial Desktop 1920 view | 
|:--------:| 
| ![initial desktop](./READMEwireframe/initialDesktop.png) | 
| This is a rough wireframe for the initial view the user sees on Desktop. The application is split into three sections. The first being the Search Navigation Bar, which locates at the top of the screen fixed to the page, containing the app logo and a search feature. The search feature will allow the user to search for key terms to filter through the posts. Moving to the second section Posts, which will display reddit's posts depending on which subreddit the user is currently in. These posts can be clicked and will be described in the detailed view. The Posts section is also located on the left side of the screen. Finally, the third section will be a list of subreddits the user can choose from and is located on the right side of the screen. The user icons represent the subreddit's icon.|

| Detailed Desktop 1920 view | 
|:--------:| 
| ![detailed desktop](./READMEwireframe/detailedDesktop.png) | 
| This is a rough wireframe for the detailed view the user sees when clicking on the reddit posts. The post that is clicked will expand fully to its section. This space is made to fit the whole media of the post including user comments. The user comments will contain how long ago the comment was made and the user it came from. To allow the user to navigate back an exit button will appear in the upper right corner of the Posts section. |

| Initial Iphone 8 view |                                         
|:--------:| 
| ![initial Iphone 8](./READMEwireframe/Initialiphone8.png) | 
| This is a rough wireframe for a mobile device, I have chosen the Iphone 8. To create space, the Subreddits section and the search feature are both hidden and only accessed through two icons which are located in the Search Navigation Bar. The Posts section spans out to the full width and the posts display the subreddit they come from. |

| Detailed Iphone 8 view | 
|:--------:| 
| ![detailed Iphone 8](./READMEwireframe/detailediphone8.png) | 
| This is a rough wireframe for the detailed view the user sees on a mobile device. The same functionality is applied here as in the "Detailed Desktop 1920 view". The only difference with this view is that the comments span across their available space to prevent the user from scrolling too much when reading the contents. And of course the fonts will have to be downsized. |
